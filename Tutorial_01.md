## What is RNA-Seq Analysis?

RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing) is a powerful technique for studying the transcriptome, the complete set of RNA scripts produced by a genome at a given time. It allows researchers to identify and quantify RNA molecules, providing insights into gene expression, alternative splicing, non-coding RNAs, and other molecular phenomena. 

## Steps in RNA-Seq Analysis

### 1. Experimental Design

* __Biological Replicates:__ Ensure enough replicates for robust statistical analysis. 
* __Treatment Conditions:__ Plan comparisons (e.g., control vs. treated).
* __Sequencing Depth:__ Decide the number of reads needed based on the complexity of the transcriptome. 

### 2. RNA Extraction and Library Preparation

* __RNA Extraction:__ Isolate high-quality RNA from cells or tissues. 
* __Quality Control:__ Assess RNA integrity (e.g., using a Bioanalyser).
* __Library Preparation:__ Convert RNA to cDNA, fragment it, and add sequencing adapters. 

### 3. Sequencing

* Use high-throughput sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina) to generate millions of short reads. 

### 4. Quality Control of Raw Data 

* __Tools:__ Use tools like FastQC to check read quality, GC content, and adapter contamination. 
* __Trimming:__ Remove low-quality reads and adapter sequences (e.g., using Trimmomatic or Cutadapt). 

### 5. Alignment to Reference Genome 

* Align reads to a reference genome or transcriptome using tools like STAR, HISAT2, or Bowtie2.
* Generate alignment files in formats like BAM or SAM. 

### 6. Transcript Assembly and Quantification 

* __Transcript Assembly:__ Use tools like StringTie or Cufflinks to reconstruct transcripts. 
* __Quantification:__ Measure gene/transcript abundance with tools like Salmon or Kallisto (quantify without alignment, if desired).

### 7. Differential Expression Analysis 

* Identidy differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between conditions using statistical tools such as DESeq2, EdgeR, and Limma-voom. 

### 8. Functional Analysis 

* Perform Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses to interpret the biological significance of DEGs. 
* Use tools like DAVID, GSEA, or Enrichr. 

### 9. Data Visualisation 

* Common plots include:
    * Heatmaps (gene expression patterns).
    * Volcano plots (DEGs).
    * PCA (sample clustering and variability).

### 10. Validation 

* Confirm key findings with independent methods, such as qPCR or Western blotting. 

## Applications of RNA-seq

* __Gene Expression Profiling:__ Study differences in gene expression between conditions. 
* __Alternative Splicing:__ Identify isoform usage and alternative splicing events. 
* __Non-Coding RNAs:__ Detect and quantidy long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) and microRNAs. 
* __Mutation Detection:__ Discover RNA editing and single nucleotide variants (SNVs).
* __De Novo Transcriptome Assembly:__ Assemble transcriptomes without a reference genome (useful for non-model organisms). 

## Common Challenges 

* __Data Volume:__ Managing and analysing large datasets can be computationally intensive. 
* __Batch Effects:__ Variability introduced by technical or biological factors must be controlled. 
* __Annotation Accuracy:__ Results depend on the quality of the reference genome and annotation.
